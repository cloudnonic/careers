# Semi-Senior Frontend React Developer
# Contractor Fulltime

Cloudnonic, an international fully remote cloud and software service company, is looking for a Semi-Senior Frontend Developer to join our awesome team. Be part of something special and make our European and North American clients happy by developing customized cloud-native systems in a variety of industries using the latest technologies.

## Who are we?

CloudNonic Corp. is a digitally native software and cloud startup located in the Kitchener/Waterloo area in Ontario, Canada. We are a fully remote company with developers in Argentina, Canada, Colombia. Our clients are spread all around the world, from Europe, North America to South America. The variety of industries we work in fascinates us. From healthcare to the financial industry, construction, and manufacturing. We are passionate about understanding our clients’ fields to best serve them with technology while also learning about their business and their industry.

We are big about the cloud. It excites us to see how quickly an idea can be transformed into a global product and launched to millions thanks to the cloud. Our services range from app and web app development to any kind of integration in the cloud you can think of. Another huge impact we have at CloudNonic is through technology consulting. We actively develop feasible, secure, and cost-effective architectures for our non-technical clients and advise them in their tech stack.

## Job Description

We are looking to expand our developer base with a positive-spirited person with programming skills. As frontend React developer, you have the opportunity to work on multiple client projects at once. Each project has its own tech stack, code, and idiosyncrasies. This is super exciting as it exposes you not only to a tremendous amount of different code, libraries, and technologies but also trains your skills to tackle any challenge that comes your way. Being able to switch from one technology to another certainly gives you a boost for your technical career development. Sooner than later, you’ll see that you’re really agile and not just writing it on your CV.

You’ll be working directly with the CEO of the company to architect the best solutions for our clients. You will be in direct contact with the client to discuss new features, present your progress, and usually a little bit of smalltalk as well. This is great because you will actively learn how to talk to clients and present your ideas in a professional yet friendly way, most of the times in English. All of this happens while having a lot of fun before, during and after work. In this position you’ll be challenged on a constant basis

## What will help you succeed:

- Being flexible & goal oriented.
- Loving to be challenged and to learn something new every day.
- Strong passion for coding.
- Promoting clean and maintainable code.
- Being a team player, yet autonomous coder, with a positive spirit.
- Learning and adopting new technologies on a constant basis with ease.
- Knowing the benefits and disadvantages of being a contractor vs. employee

We are welcoming a self-starter and self-motivated engineer that can organize his/her day autonomously. We trust in you and your ability to prioritize tasks throughout the week and keep the team and clients updated along the way.

## Requirements

- Speak fluently one or more languages: English, Spanish, German
- 1-2 years of full-time coding experience in /React
- Experience in React (Native)
- Experience with the JavaScript ecosystem (e.g. npm)
- Experience with JSON and RESTful services
- Experience with Agile Methodologies

## Bonus:

- Experience with Redux Toolkit, MUI, Tailwind
- Playwright / Cypress (Testing)
- Fluent English (B2+)
- Good concise and efficient communication (written and oral)

## What Do We Offer?

Fully Remote: WFH (work from home) or anywhere you want. We embrace the location-independent way of working, and we know you do too.

Huge Technical Exposure: The number of technologies and challenges you’ll be facing in a short amount of time is spectacular. Ever experienced that you got bored by the same repositories. That’s not going to happen at CloudNonic.

International Global Client Exposure: Our clients are based in the US, Canada, Germany, Colombia, among other countries. We are excited about the different languages, (corporate) cultures and people you’ll get to work with.

Competitive Pay: Depending on your seniority and skill level we offer a competitive monthly pay at your local market rate. By the way, we can pay you in any currency you prefer.

Payment in Crypto: We offer to pay in cryptocurrency, in case you want.

Uber Credit: Everybody needs an Uber at some point during the month. At Cloudnonic you'll be covered with a monthly Uber credit.

Fulltime Contractor: We know you manage your money better than any employer could ever do. That’s why we appreciate you as a contractor to streamline your finances. (Please make sure you know your responsibilities as a contractor)

Flexible Work Time: At CloudNonic we know that everyone is different and has different schedules and biological rhythms. We work in multiple time zones. You can work whenever you want because we trust you to get your stuff done.

Great Company Culture: We want to have fun and a great time while we work. We think the time of a hierarchical strict corporate culture is over. We are convinced that it’s possible to find the balance between working hard, feeling accomplished while enjoying the journey by having a good time.

Gaming: Who doesn’t have fun playing an online game in Steam against your colleagues while being connected in Discord. Yep, that’s what we do at CloudNonic.

Professional Development: At CloudNonic we want to foster the growth of knowledge, that’s why we sponsor online courses and certifications on demand.

Career Development: Develop your career within multiple industries and get knowledge not only about code but expertise about an industry.
